This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting. `Version: 6`.<br>
You can read the subject: [`push_swap.pdf`](subject/push_swap.pdf)


### Discription of mandatory part
## Challenge

Sort a random list of integers using the smallest number of moves, 2 stacks
and a limited set of operations. <br />
<br />

You start with two empty stacks: **a** and **b**. You are given a random list of integers via command line arguments.
<br />
<br />

Only these moves are allowed:
- `sa` : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
- `sb` : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
- `ss` : `sa` and `sb` at the same time.
- `pa` : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do
nothing if b is empty.
- `pb` : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do
nothing if a is empty.
- `ra` : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes
the last one.
- `rb` : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- `rr` : `ra` and `rb` at the same time.
- `rra` : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- `rrb` : reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- `rrr` : `rra` and `rrb` at the same time.
<br />

At the end, **stack b** must empty empty and all integers must be in **stack a**, sorted in ascending order. <br />
<br />


## The Project
Create two programs: ```checker``` and ```push_swap```. <br />

The ```checker``` program reads a random list of integers from the stdin, stores them, and checks to see
if they are sorted. <br />
<br />
The ```push_swap``` program calculates the moves to sort the integers â€“ *pushing, popping, swapping* and *rotating* 
them between **stack a** and **stack b** â€“ and displays those directions on the stdout. <br />
<br />
You can pipe ```push_swap``` into ```checker```, and ```checker``` will verify that ```push_swap```'s instructions were successful. 
<br />

Both programs must mandatorily parse input for errors, including empty strings, no parameters, 
non-numeric parameters, duplicates, and invalid/non-existent instructions.

**Push_Swap** must conform to the [42 Norm](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/960/norme.en.pdf). <br />
Using normal ```libc``` functions is strictly forbidden. Students are however, allowed to use: ```write```, ```read```, ```malloc```, ```free```, ```exit```. 
It must not have any memory leaks. Errors must be handled carefully. <br />
In no way can it quit in an unexpected manner (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc).

All errors like: wrong commands,  permission to files and etc, need be handle.
